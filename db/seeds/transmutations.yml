  more: "\tAccording to several studies, gratitude has been viewed as a crucial determinant of well-being. Gratitude helps create emotional foundations of peace and happiness, as well as affecting a multitude of areas that increase the quality of our life.\n\nProSocial Behavior\n\tResearch in the social effects of gratitude include grateful people tending to interpret help as being more valuable, by interpreting deeper expressions of kindness and caring, allowing for stronger social bonds. One study also found that gratitude cultivates thicker emotional skin, as demonstrated by gratitude practicers doing better to keep their bearing in the face of rude or negative interactions compared to their non-practicing counterparts.\n\nPhysical Vitality\n\tGratitude brings balance to the body. Grateful people are projected to have greater optimism across adult years. Research links optimism with positive health outcomes across time. Gratitude is also shown to be a strong cultivator of conscientiousness, a trait that encourages proactivity, getting good nutrition, maintaining a social support base, and responsibly seeking medical care when needed. There is evidence that gratitude journaling also increases the likelihood of exercising—as one study found gratitude practicing groups exercised for 1.5 more hours on average per week than their non-practicing counterparts.\n\nSleep Quality\n\tIn matters of sleep, gratitude practice predicts greater subjective sleep quality, sleep duration, and less sleep latency and daytime dysfunction.  This relationship has been established through pre-sleep thoughts that affect sleep quality, indicating that gratitude listing before bed is helpful for better sleep. A 2009 study of 401 people—40% of whom had clinical sleep disorders—found that the most grateful people had better sleep quality, normalized sleep duration, were able to fall asleep faster, and had less daytime tiredness compared to those who weren’t as thankful.\n\nRelieving Stress\n\tStress reactivity is measured through psychological health. Because gratitude eases stress reactivity by its impact on our psychological health, we put our bodies through less stress and conserve energy. This results in feeling generally more peaceful.\n\nIntervention Success\n\tIt is conceivable that individuals with excellent mental health to begin with are those more likely to practice gratitude in the first place. Although true, it does not explain the success of gratitude interventions, whereby individuals from a wide range of age groups and occupations saw significant psychological and physiological improvements by the sole act of recording grateful thoughts. To be sure, studies have also controlled for the Big Five Personality Types to confirm that personality did not play a role in receiving benefits with gratitude journaling."

Also awards higher self-esteem, better sleep quality, stronger immunity, nervous system, and cardiovascular system, less bodily inflammation, greater emotional intelligence, and a longer life span."
  tips: "-If possible, try to opt for an in-person connection first, a video call second, and a phone call as a last resort. Research shows that face-to-face connections are more powerful than digitally connecting, and is shown to protect from symptoms of depression as we age.\n\n-Initiating contact with a friend or loved one every so often not only benefits you but also them! By taking the initiative to say hello, you also provide the other person with a sense of being wanted and loved."
  more: " The World Health Organization holds social connection as one of the leading determinants of health, among diet and exercise.

  The benefits from social connection comes not from the size of social network but our internal and subjective sense of connection. Thus having just one person we can connect with is more helpful than having ten friends we don’t connect with.

Physical Vitality
  Research indicates that strong social connection leads to a 50% increased chance of a longer lifespan. The presence of a supportive person or even thinking about supportive others can reduce cardiovascular and neuroendocrine responses to stress. Evidence, particularly in animal models, shows that social connections are causally associated with health-relevant biological pathways at multiple levels from gene expression to neural functioning.
  Supportive interactions with others benefit immune, endocrine, and cardiovascular functions and reduce allostatic load, which reflects wear and tear on the body due, in part, to chronically overworked physiological systems engaged in stress responses. Social support in adulthood reduces physiological responses such as cardiovascular reactivity to both anticipated and existing stressors. Studies show greater overall involvement with formal and informal social ties (from religious organizations to friends and relatives) were associated with more positive behaviors conducive to health over a ten-year period.

Immunity
  Research by Steve Cole shows that genes impacted by social connection also code for immune function. Evidence suggests social connection strengthens our immune system.

Self-worth and Empathy
 Studies show that social ties leads to higher self esteem, empathy, trust, cooperation, and openness, as well as reductions in depression and anxiety.

Connection Priority
  Evidence shows that a lack of social connection is a greater detriment to health than obesity, smoking, and high blood pressure. Additional dangers include higher inflammation at the cellular level, higher susceptibility to anxiety and depression, poorer sleep efficiency and quality, elevations in circulating levels of cortisol (which increase stress), slower recovery from disease, increased antisocial behavior, violence, and suicidal behaviors. Research provides consistent and compelling evidence linking social isolation with a host of conditions, including development of cardiovascular disease, recurrent myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, autonomic dysregulation, high blood pressure, and cancer. Additionally, social isolation is also harmful because of an absence of others to prompt positive health practices and deter deviant ones.
  Risk of death among men and women with the fewest social ties were more than twice as high as the risk for adults with more social ties. Among adults with coronary artery disease, the socially isolated had a risk of subsequent cardiac death 2.4 times greater then their more socially connected peers.
  In response to the idea that those with poorer mental or physical health are prone to be less connected to begin with, it should be noted that numerous studies maintain the benefits of social connection after holding for factors such as age, race, socioeconomic status, health status as a baseline, and health practices such as exercise, alcohol consumption, and smoking.

Purpose
  Compassion and volunteering have huge health benefits and create a sense of connection and purpose. Social ties can instill a sense of responsibility and concern for others that lead individuals to engage in behaviors that protect the health of others, and in so doing their own health.

Medical Costs
  Importantly, social connections influence a number of health-relevant behaviors that are widely recognized for their economic costs to the individual, family, and the broader health care system.

Face-To-Face Over Phone Calls
  According to a 2015 study by Oregon Health & Science University, face-to-face calls are much more effective than phone calls in lessening the likelihood of becoming impaired with depression. The study found that participants who regularly met in person with family and friends were less likely to report symptoms of depression compared with participants who emailed or spoke on the phone. The gains people derived from face-to-face socializing endured even years later.

  more: "Perspective
  Under normal circumstances, people tend to narrow their attention on an immediate threat, a response that promotes swift self-protection. But, when self-affirmed with their core values, people can see the many ordinary stressors of daily life in the context of the big picture and remember what’s truly important.

Acceptance
  If a threat is seen as important and addressable, affirmations make it less likely that people will shrink away from the threat or deny its importance to themselves. Self-Affirmed participants in one study asserted that the threatening domain was more important to them than their non-affirming counterparts. People can thus better deal with the threat in a constructive way, rather than spend their energy in avoidance. Overall, affirmations lift psychological barriers to change by lessening psychological threat and cutting off defensive reactions.

Cognition
  Affirming one’s core values has been linked to higher executive functioning. Executive functioning includes the ability to pay attention, organize and plan, initiate tasks and stay focused on them, regulate emotions, and maintain self-control.
Self-Worth
  Affirmations have been found to help people maintain a narrative of personal adequacy in threatening circumstances. They thus buffer individuals against threats and reduce defensive reactions. Cognitive power and problem solving abilities are maintained in the face of threats.

Security
  Studies show that defensive denial, bias, and distortion in one domain are lessened by affirmations of self-integrity in another. For example, self-affirmed individuals are found to be more open to a scientific report linking their behavior to cancer risk.

Inner Peace
  A study led by psychologist Traci Mann of UCLA found that participants who affirmed their values had significantly lower cortisol (a stress hormone) responses to stress compared with control participants. These findings suggest that reflecting on personal values can keep neuroendocrine and psychological responses to stress at low levels, leading to stronger cognition and a decreased risk for diseases.


Academic Performance
  In a 2010 study, students either wrote about their most important values or not, twice at the beginning of the 15-week course. Values affirmation substantially elevated women’s modal grades from the C to B range. Benefits were strongest for women who tended to endorse the stereotype that men do better than women in physics.
Willpower
  In a study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in 2009, researchers found that affirming one’s values can replenish willpower when it’s been depleted by repeated acts of self-control. The researchers concluded that self-affirmation holds promise as a mental strategy that reduces the likelihood of self-control failure.

Receptivity
  Joshua Correll of the University of Chicago found that a values-affirmation exercise allowed subjects in his study to objectively evaluate information that would otherwise evoke a defensive reaction. The participants become less biased in favor of their own position, and more disarming in evaluating the strength or weakness of arguments made by others.

Willingness to Change
  A 2015 study conducted at the University of Pennsylvania found that sedentary participants who were guided through self-affirming exercises concerning values showed higher activity in the brain processes related to self-relevance after receiving medical advice. This led to higher levels of physical activity in the month following the intervention compared to the control group. The study’s lead author, Emily Falk, wrote “Our findings highlight that something as simple as reflecting on core values can fundamentally change the way our brains respond to the kinds of messages we encounter every day. Over time, that makes the potential impact huge.

Attentiveness and Receptivity
  In a study published in the journal of Psychological Science in 2012, researcher Michael Inzlicht of the University of Toronto and his coauthors found that people who had affirmed their values were more receptive to negative feedback and better able to recognize and correct their mistakes. They concluded that self-affirmation produces large effects. Even a simple reminder of one’s core values reduces defensiveness against threatening information.

Closing the Achievement Gap
  Multiple studies by professor Geoffrey Cohen of Stanford University and others have found that affirming one’s values raises the test scores of minority students, and of female students in science and math classes. A reminder of one’s core values seems to protect these students from “stereotype threat”—that is, concerns about their ability to succeed because of their gender or race.

  instructions: "Recite 3 self affirming statements out loud, 3 times each, visualizing yourself embodying each statement in a future scenario."
  explanation: "Grants better problem-solving skills, stronger resilience, improved health and relationship outcomes, greater ability to implement new positive behaviors. Protects psychological wellbeing, and awards a higher sense of self-empowerment."
  tips: "-Visualizing yourself embodying the affirmation in the future is critical for the full effects of this transmutation.\n\n-The subconscious mind is most open to affirmations while we are in the “alpha” brainwave state—our most relaxed state of mind. The alpha wave frequency is often achieved in a meditative state or just before falling asleep—creating an optimal time to recite one’s affirmations. Music designed to create the alpha wave state can also help. Thus, you can increase the effects of this transmutation if you recite your affirmations in the alpha state.\n\nSample affirmations:\n\t-I am a touring musician, performing in a new city every week and sharing the notes of my heart with the world.\n\n\t-I am self-made. I am the owner of my own business, earning thousands of dollars and  fulfilling my customers’ needs by adding value to their lives.\n\n\t-I am an A-list actor, working every day to give life to the best narratives in cinema.\n\n\t-I am a prolific writer, constantly filling pages with my ideas and earning an income doing what I love."
  more: "Celebrities on affirmations:

Lady Gaga
“It’s sort of like a mantra. You repeat it to yourself every day. ‘Music is may life, music is my life. The fame is inside of me, I’m going to make a number one record with number one hits.”

Will Smith
“Our thoughts, our feelings, our dreams, our ideas are physical in the Universe.”

Jim Carrey
“As far as I can tell, it’s just about letting the universe know what you want and then working towards it while letting go of how it comes to pass”

In 1985, Jim Carrey wrote himself a $10 million dollar check for “acting services renders” dating it 10 years in the future and kept it in his wallet. In 1995, he found out he was going to make $10 million dollars for Dumb and Dumber.

Problem-Solving
  Studies show that at the behavioral level, self-affirmation improves problem-solving performance on tasks related to executive functioning. Numerous studies highlight that thinking about self-preferences activates neural reward pathways. A group of researchers hypothesized that self-affirmation would activate brain reward circuitry during functional MRI studies. Their findings suggest that “self-affirmation may be rewarding and may provide a first step toward identifying a neural mechanism by which self-affirmation may product beneficial effects.”

Perspective
  Scientists and behavioral care providers suggest that self-affirmation reminds people of important aspects of the self, enabling them to view events from a reasonable, considered and rational point of view. By enhancing the psychological resources of self-integrity, self-affirmation reduces defensive responses to threatening information and events, leading to positive outcomes in various areas such as psychological and physical health, education, prejudice, discrimination, and social conflicts.

Behavioral Change
  Research has found evidence of neural processes associated with the act of self-affirmation. Regions of Interest (ROIs) analyses revealed that affirmed relative to control participants showed significantly greater activity in the positive valuation regions of the brain, and that this effect was driven by affirmations focusing on future rather than past experiences.
  In one study, increased activity in reward/valuation regions during self-affirmation were linked with decreases in sedentary behavior following the affirmation intervention (that promoted proactivity). Thus evidence suggests that affirmations make people more open to behavior change.

Psychological Wellbeing
  One account of why self affirmations are successful is attributed to their ability to broaden a person’s overall perspective and reduce the effect of negative emotions. Researchers have suggested that self-affirmations remind individuals of psychosocial resources that extend beyond a specific threat, which allows them to focus on sources of positive self-worth that transcends the threat. This in turn is thought to reduce reactivity to the threat and protect overall psychological wellbeing. One possible source of regulatory resources include the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which have been implicated in regulation of emotion and facilitating difficult choices. Self-affirmations may work by priming these regions to regulate emotions.

Self-Empowerment
  A study involving 282 people found that participants who wrote about their most important negotiating skill (as opposed to least important in the control) performed significantly better negotiating in sales exercises than their counterparts. Thus affirmations that reflect our strengths help us perform better.

Reading can be helpful to fill in downtime during the day and achieve your 5 page goal. You could read while (e.g) waiting to be called into an appointment, standing on the train during a commute, or waiting for your food to arrive at a restaurant."
  more: "Relieving Stress
  According to a 2009 study from Sussex University, reading was 68% better at reducing stress levels than listening to music, 100% more effective than drinking a cup of tea, 300% better than going for a walk, and 700% more effective than playing video games. Reading for as little as 6 minutes is sufficient to reduce stress levels by 60%, slowing heart beat, easing muscle tension, and altering the state of mind.

Income
  According to the Adult Literacy in America Survey (2002) individuals demonstrating higher levels of literacy were more likely to be employed, work more weeks in a year, and earn higher wages than individuals demonstrating lower proficiencies. Nearly half (41 to 44 percent) of all adults in the lowest level on each literacy scale were living in poverty, compared with only 4 to 8 percent of those in the two highest proficiency levels.

Creativity
  In a 2013 study, 100 participants were assigned to read either an essay or a short story. By a measurement for patients need for cognitive closure following each readings, results found that reading fictional literature could lead to better procedures of processing information, including those involved in creativity.

Cognition
  Verbal intelligence is the ability to analyze information and solve problems using language-based reasoning. From social communication to texting and email, our world is built around listening to or reading words for meaning and expressing knowledge throughs spoken language. According to research, reading volume is a significant contributor to the development of aspects of verbal intelligence such as vocabulary, general knowledge, spelling, and verbal fluency.
Blood Flow
  In one study, results showed that when participants were focused on reading a novel, blood flow in the brain increased to many regions beyond those responsible for executive function. According to the study, paying attention to literary texts specifically requires the coordination of multiple complex cognitive functions.
Brain Connectivity
  In a 2013 study, participants read 1/9th of a novel during the evening and resting-state imaging scans took place the next morning. On the days after the reading, significant increases in connectivity were centered on hubs in the left angular/supramarginal gyro and right postural temporal gyri. The supramarginal gyrus is involved in a number of processes related to language, number processing, spacial cognition, memory retrieval, and theory of mind. Additionally, long-term changes were observed as dispersed bilaterally in the somatosensory cortex—a part of the brain in charge of making sense of tactile representations. This implies that the brain is using the same regions for interpreting physical touch when one reads about a physical reality.

Memory
  A 2006 study involving participants reading poetry from Shakespeare, Wordsworth, T.S. Eliot and others found high activity in the language areas of the brain. Regions of the brain associated with personal memories were found to be active during the reading as well, indicating how poetry can nudge us to draw from personal experiences. A 2013 study at Emory university found that his increased brain activity was found to last at least several days after reading.

Life Span
  A 2016 study found that, compared to non-book readers, book readers were at a 20% reduction in the risk of mortality over the 12 years of follow up. These findings suggest that the benefits of reading books is a longer life. Another study mirrored these findings, concluding that book readers lived an average of almost 2 years longer than those who did not read at all. This survival advantage remained after adjusting for wealth, education, cognitive ability, and many other variables.
Prosocial Behavior
  Some statistics show a relationship between book reading and positive social engagement. According to a report from Hill Strategies Research, the percentage of book readers volunteering for a non-profit organization (42%) is much higher than the percentage of non-readers (25%). 71% of book readers (compared to 65% of non-readers) indicated that they had done a favor for a neighbor in the past month. 49% of book reader were indicated to have a very strong sense of national belonging compared with 42% of non-readers.
Empathy
  According to one study, readers of fiction tend to have better abilities of empathy and theory of mind than non-readers. This finding stood even when accounting for individual differences such as the tendency to be drawn into stories and gender. Fiction exposure predicted performance on empathy tasks. Additionally, fiction was positively correlated with social support. It is theorized that individuals exposed to more narrative fictions felt they had more people available to speak to, drawing support from the fictional characters that they encounter in novels, engaging in a form of par asocial relationship. Research has demonstrated that our favorite fictional characters can influence us in a manner similar to real peers, particularly if they are seen as “real.”

Self-Knowledge
  In a research study investigating the role of pleasure reading in the lives of adolescents, results supported the concept that teens gain significant insights into self-identification, self-construction, and self-awareness, all of which aid them in the transition from childhood to adulthood. In fact, some teens felt that their reading for pleasure had given the more than information and insight; it had empowered them to have strong beliefs and act on those beliefs in the future. One participant stated that she frequently read books about slavery and racism to help her understand discrimination and ways to help fight it. Several teens noted that they had learned about the dangers of high risk behaviors through their pleasure reading. Many teens commented that their pleasure reading had played an important role in their developing a sense of social conscience and the ability to connect imaginatively with others, as well as understand events of history and current social issues.

Physical and Mental Wellbeing
  According to the Statistical Insights on Arts, results derived from a survey of about 7,500 Canadians age 15 and older, book readers, on average, were 28% more likely to report that they had very good or excellent health, 74% more likely to volunteer, and 15% more likely to report very strong satisfaction with life.

  instructions: "Spend 20 minutes engaged in one of your passions."
  explanation: "Grants higher psychological well-being, a more wholesome self-identity, self-growth, a healthier brain, and greater physical health. Protects against heart disease, stress, anxiety, depression, low blood pressure, and awards better sleep quality."
  tips: "-Try dedicating the same time, every day, to your passion. This will help build this into a habit that you can stick with.\n\n-If you have many passions, try sticking to just one for this transmutation. The feeling of growth and success is multiplied when we stick to one passion instead of spending time on multiple passions where the feedback of progress is much slower."
  more: " A scientific study defines passion as a strong inclination toward a self-defining activity that one loves, finds important, and in which one invests time and energy on a regular basis.

Psychological Wellbeing
  A study on people pursuing their passion found that passion contributes to sustained psychological well-being while preventing the experience of negative affect, psychological conflict, and ill-being. Psychological well-being translates to happiness, life satisfaction, and self-growth. This happiness is associated with better physical health, better relationships, and high-level performance. Another 2005 study mirrored these findings, suggesting that “happiness-relevant activities” represents one way to facilitate psychological well-being.

Physical Vitality
  Since the engagement of passionate activities promotes positive psychological well being, our physical health is also positively affected. A 2012 study found, in general, positive psychological well-being consistently protects against cardiovascular disease, independently of traditional risk factors and ill-being. Psychological wellbeing is also positively associated with restorative health behaviors and biological function. Researchers believe this link may be explained by the effect a healthier mind has on maintaining physical health—that is, we are more likely to engage in good habits: exercising, eating a balanced diet, and getting enough sleep if our psychological wellbeing is looked after. In turn, these benefits translate to improved sleep quality, lower blood pressure, lower risk of heart disease, lower risk of stress, anxiety, and depression.

Self-Identity
  According to one study, passionate activities come to be so self-defining that they represent features to one’s identity.  For instance, those who have a passion for playing basketball or songwriting do not merely engage in these activities. They see themselves as “basketball players” or “songwriters.”  Thus, a passionate activity is something that comes to define oneself, which contributes to a sense of wholeness.

Self-Growth
  When passionate about a given activity, people become “expert” in this activity and grow psychologically as individuals—thus their self in this sphere of activity becomes increasingly complex.

Brain Growth
  Intellectual enrichment has been link with enhanced neuroplasticity, or the brain’s ability to make new connections and grow new neurons in both animal and human studies. A german study, for example found that adults who became proficient jugglers showed increased brain volume on imaging studies.

  instructions: "Write down something new that you notice today among your everyday activities."
  explanation: "Grants enhanced self-control, better focus, social skills, job performance, and emotional, mental and physical wellbeing. Reduces stress, anxiety, and depression. Also grants stronger immunity, healthier blood pressure and heart rate, inner peace, and a more positive connection to reality."
  tips: "-The goal of mindfulness practice is to increase your awareness through your senses and becoming more present.\n\n-You can become more present by simply noticing something new in an experience you’ve had hundreds of times.\n\nExamples:\n\t-I felt the groups of the bristles of my toothbrush sway against my teeth this morning—they were incredibly soft.\n\n\t-I caught sight and noticed, for the first time, a pattern on a rug we have in the living room today. There were four flower petals in repeated fashion, branching out of each other.\n\n\t-Walking by a park at my house, I smelled fresh cut grass and some flowers nearby—it reminded me of my old neighborhood.\n\n\t-I really tasted the spices of some of the curry I had for dinner. There was a kick from the cayenne pepper—and it went well with moist textures of the jasmine rice.\n\n\t-I focused on the touch and motion of my hands as I tied the trash bag when taking out the garbage today. It was smooth."
  more: "Relieving Stress
  A study on present-moment awareness found that mindfulness facilitates an adaptive response to daily stressors. Another study by the same authors found evidence that mindfulness produced less avoidance and more approach coping as response to stress than relaxation or self-affirmation controls. Evidence suggests mindfulness can help alleviate stress by improving emotion regulation, leading to a better mood and better ability to handle stress. This impact can be seen in those who suffer from restless leg syndrome, parents, healthcare professionals, veterans with depression and/or PTSD, and police officers.  Benefits include higher brain functioning, increased immune function, lower blood pressure, lowered heart rate, increased awareness and focus, increased clarity, lower anxiety levels, increase feelings of calm and connection to reality.

Relieving Depression
  Mindfulness has been found to decrease symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in college students as well as increase self-compassion when compared with yoga alone. This is achieved by enhancing practitioners’ ability regulate their emotions. Mindfulness provides tools needed to step back from intense negative emotions, identify them, and accept them instead of fighting them. This leads to being able to better regulate emotion, leading to better coping and management of depression.
   One study found that, MBCT (Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy) reduced depressive episodes, which not only helped participants feel better but also had positive impacts on their health costs. In chronically depressed participants with suicidal thoughts, mindfulness was more effective than treatment as usual in reducing these thoughts.

Resilience
  One of the most studied groups in terms of impacts of mindfulness are cancer patients suffering from chronic or potentially terminal illness.  Mindfulness is shown to help reduce the magnitude of their symptoms.  eCALM trial, a therapy program for cancer patients found that mindfulness can reduce symptoms of stress, enhance spirituality and non-reactivity to experience, facilitate post-traumatic growth, and enhance vigor while relieving fatigue.
   Mindfulness is linked to decreasing rumination and worry and increasing observing and non-judging in cancer patients. Exploration of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction, a program that teaches mindfulness techniques, is found to help those suffering from chronic low back pain by improving the patients’ ability to function independently and lessen their back pain compared to treatment as usual. It is shown to help patients focus less on the pain, improving their quality of life.


Recovery
  A study of MBSR in Chinese breast cancer survivors provided evidence that mindfulness can enhance post traumatic growth and decrease stress and anxiety in cancer patients. Another study of young breast cancer survivors showed that women who practiced mindfulness were most likely to experienced increased self-kindness, decreased rumination, and decreased stress.




Physical Vitality
  A study of how two facets of mindfulness impact health behaviors found that practicing mindfulness can enhance or increase multiple behaviors related to health such as getting regular health checkups, being physically active, and avoiding nicotine and alcohol.
  Another study showed that mindfulness is related to improved cardiovascular health through a lower incidence of smoking, more physical activity, and a healthier Body Mass Index. Mindfulness is also linked with lower blood pressure. Overweight practitioners of mindfulness can also benefit as mindfulness is shown to help participants lose weight, and improve their eating behaviors and attitudes.

Healthy traits
  A study on mindfulness in college students found that medical and psychology students who practiced mindfulness reported improvements in a wide range of areas, including decreased reactivity, increased curiosity and affect tolerance, improved patience, and self-acceptance, and enhanced relationship qualities.
   College students who participated in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) reported enhanced self-control and vitality, among other outcomes. Similarly, a study on mindfulness and emotion regulation in college students found that higher levels of mindfulness predicted better regulation of emotions, leading to more positive inhibition of destructive behaviors and in turn greater psychological wellbeing.

Academic Performance
  Elementary students who practice mindfulness exhibit greater prosocial behaviors, emotion regulation, and academic performance. Teenagers studying for a general education certificate who participated in a mindfulness program experienced lower depression and anxiety which helped academic attainment. Children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds reported that after a 5-week mindfulness program, lower stress levels allowed them higher focus in school.

Attention and Concentration
  As a result of an 8 week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction course, participants demonstrated significantly improved orienting in attention and concentration in comparison with the control group. Results suggested that mindfulness training may improve attention-related behavioral responses by enhancing functioning of specific subcomponents of attention.

Sleep
  A study using mindfulness meditation found that results helped overall reduction in sleep latency and total wake time, and an increase in total sleep after mindfulness therapy using both patient reported outcomes and quantitative measures of sleep.

Mind-Body Connection
  A study looking at brain patterns in weightlifters found that patterns activated when a weightlifter lifted hundreds of pounds were similarly activated when they only imagined lifting. In some cases, research has revealed that mental practices are almost effective as true physical practice and that doing both is more effective than either alone. The study found that mental training enhances the brain’s cortical output signal which translates to higher activation level in muscle and an increase in strength.
  A 2004 study split 30 people into 2 groups. One group did physical training exercises with their little finger. The other group imagined doing the same training.  Group 1 saw increases in finger strength by 53%, and group 2, doing nothing but mental rehearsal, increased their strength by 35%.
  Research conducted by Australian psychologist Alan Richardson confirmed the phenomenon that a person who consistently visualizes a certain physical skill develops “Muscle memory” which helps when physically engaging in an activity.  Richardson chose three groups of students at random—none had ever practiced visualization. The first group practiced free throws every day for 20 days. The second group made free throws on the first and 20th day, as did the third group.  But members of the third group spent 20 minutes every day visualizing free throws. On the 20th day the group that practice daily improved 24 percent. The second group improved not at all. The third group, which has physically practiced no more than the second, improved an astonishingly 23 percent—just as well as the first group.
  According to an article from the Scientific American, visualizing movement changes how our brain networks are organized, creating more connections among different regions. It stimulates brain regions involved in rehearsal of movement, such as the putamen located in forebrain, priming the brain and body for action so that we move more effectively.


Imagination and Memory
  A 2013 study found that the brain does not differentiate between a real memory and an imagined or visualized one. This indicates that when we imagine something vividly and with emotion, our brain chemistry changes as though the experience was real, and our mind records it as a real memory. Thus, visualization allows us to overcome self-doubt and build confidence by storing positive “memories” of imagined events.

Achievement
  A 2010 study found that students with a goal of consuming extra portions of fruit every day for a week were much more likely to meet their goal when asked to visualize themselves eating more fruit. In contrast, the group that did not employ visualizations did not come as close to meeting their goal.
   A 2013 study reported similar findings. Participants who visualized themselves in the 1st person eating more fruit were found to have better self-efficacy and action planning to meet their intention than other groups who did not use visualization or visualized themselves in the 3rd person rather than the 1st. Notably, participants were successful only when they were also aware of the health benefits. Thus to maximize the impact of our visualization its important to have a clear understanding as to why we are focusing on our particular vision and what it means to us.
   Additionally, a study published at the Academy of Management found that using specific visual imagery in corporate visions helped employees unite around their goals. American Author and corporate trainer Jack Canfield (co-author of the worldwide success “Chicken Soup for the Soul series”) writes: “When we visualize goals as complete, it creates a conflict in our subconscious mind between what we are visualizing and what we currently have. Our minds are hard-wired to resolve such conflicts by working to create a current reality that matches the one we have envisioned.”

Opportunity
  The Reticular Activating System (RAS) is a part of the brain that acts as a filter between the conscious and subconscious mind. It is the system responsible for filtering what we can pay attention to at any given moment—blocking out vast amounts of information in favor of the information we are intending to look for. The RAS thinks in pictures, not words. By visualizing our desired outcomes on a regular basis, we feed the RAS images to look out for and it will start filtering images accordingly. As a result, the RAS will begin paying attention to the things we have decided will help us achieve our goals—information that would previously have been filtered out as irrelevant.

Relieving Self Doubt
  According to Margaret Ottley, PhD, professor of sport and exercise psychology, “…positive visualization lets you eliminate nerves and self doubt.”  Thus we are better able to handle obstacles along the way toward our goals.


Self-Healing
  Psychiatrist Srinivasan Pillay writes that by visualizing lifting our right hand, it stimulates the same part of the brain that is activated when we actually lift our right hand. This shared area of brain activation when we imagine an action and perform it has been demonstrated extensively in the scientific literature. Similarly, visualization can also increase brain activation seen in stroke. When a person has a stroke due to a blood clot in a brain artery, blood cannot reach the tissue that the artery once fed with oxygen and nutrients, and that tissue dies. However, if a person with stroke imagines moving the affected arm or leg, brain blood flow to the affected area increases and the surrounding brain tissue can be saved.

Self-Empowerment
  According to Dr. David Hamilton, “When you visualize on better health or achieving a goal, it brings you a sense of inner empowerment.  This is because you start to notice small changes in your life as you move in the direction you want to go in. With health, you start to see improvements and it brings you a belief in yourself and in the process of what you are doing. The effect of this is that it shifts the sense of power away from the outside world toward the inside. This makes all the difference because it breeds motivation, creativity, and positive emotion.”

- name: "Meditation"
  category: 0
  level: 9
  tier: 5
  mana: 5
  instructions: "Meditate for 1 minute"
  explanation: "Reduces stress, anxiety, depression, and protects against cancer. Grants better sleep quality, stronger immunity, healthier blood pressure, greater pain tolerance, self-discipline and sharper focus."
  tips: "How to Meditate:
-First find a quiet space to sit cross legged, you can also use a chair. Sit up straight, and do not lean your back on anything.

-Second, Start your timer.

-Third, Close your eyes and inhale deeply from your diaphragm.  Exhale fully.  Focus your attention on following the breath in this continuous fashion—like a surfer on the waves.
-Random thoughts will attempt to pull your attention away from your breath. That’s okay! The key is to realize what is happening and to refocus on the breath. The very act of refocusing your attention is akin to doing a dumbbell curl. Like a dumbbell curl, there is resistance! Work with it. Keep starting over, and over, and over, and refocusing!

-Like in the gym, do not expect to make massive progress on your first try.  Be patient with yourself and be consistent.

-Meditating first thing in the morning is helpful as the brain is just coming out of a slow-wave brain state. This will make it easier to get into a meditative state.

-Meditating in the same place can be beneficial as it will form an association between your brain’s ability to “zone in” and a particular setting.

-Try to meditate both indoors and outdoors to see which settings works best for you

  more: " According to a 2012 U.S. survey, Meditation is the 3rd most commonly requested complementary and alternative medicine therapy.  For example, research indicates that meditation can improve symptoms of stress related conditions that include irritable bowel syndrome, PTSD, fibromyalgia (widespread muscle pain), and a variety of cancers.

Relieving Stress
  A study involving over 3,500 adults linked meditation with reduced stress.  One study on transcendental meditation found that the practice was more effective than treatment as usual and most alternative treatments with treating anxiety. The relief was magnified in those with greater levels of stress. There is evidence that meditation helps provide a sense of well-being as well as reduce symptoms of anxiety disorders such as phobias, social anxiety, paranoid thoughts, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and panic attacks. According to one long term study, such improvements in stress persisted after a 3 year follow up, so long as participants continued to practice. Research also shows that Meditation increases activation of the body’s parasympathetic system, which is responsible for making us feel relaxed.

Relieving Depression
  There is substantial evidence that meditation therapies help with clinical depressive disorders during acute and subacute phases of treatment. One study followed 18 volunteers as they practiced meditation over 3 years. The study found that participants experienced long-term decreases in depression. There is evidence that meditation increases serotonin, a chemical that contributes to us feeling happy—the same chemical that many antidepressants aim to conserve to effectively treat depression.

Immune system
  A study on the effects of meditation found significant increases in antibody titer (amount of antibodies produced) to an influenza vaccine among meditators compared with non-meditators. Thus meditation strengthens the immune system. This same study found that meditation  reduces oxidative stress, enhances levels of endogenous antioxidants and activity of antioxidant enzymes. These changes result in increasing the body’s ability to fight against cancer and disease.

Optimism
  Research shows meditation leads to significant increases in left-side anterior activation, a pattern associated with feeling positive. Studies also show that meditation increases dopamine, a chemical responsible for making us feel motivated and happy.

Focus
  Meditation is shown to raise norepinephrine, a chemical that helps us think clearer, faster, and stay more focused. A study involving office workers found that participants reported lower levels of stress and showed better memory for tasks they had performed; they also switched tasks less often and remained focused on tasks longer.

Compassion
  Twenty-two studies on Metta, a type of meditation also known as loving-kindness meditation, have demonstrated its ability to increase people’s compassion toward themselves and others. This translated to health benefits for the health of individuals in question and their respective communities.

Self-Discipline
  A 2009 study found evidence that connects exercising self-discipline with a portion of the brain called the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) as signaled by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Research shows that meditation fortifies the DLPFC, thus strengthening our self-discipline.
  A study with participants involved in recovering from alcohol addiction found that participants marked meditation as helpful in “real-life skills for coping with craving” and “gaining skills to reduce stress.”  In the 16-week exit survey following, subjects continued to report high satisfaction with and usefulness of meditation as a therapy for their alcohol addiction. Another review of 14 studies that investigated mindfulness meditation as a primary intervention for binge and emotional eating found it to be effective for treatment.

Sleep
  A study using mindfulness meditation found that results helped overall reduction in sleep latency, a reduction in total wake time, and an increase in total sleep time.

Relieving Pain
  Research shows that meditation activates brain regions related to the self-regulation of pain. Areas involved in cognitive control, emotion regulation, and interoceptive awareness were more active during meditation compared to before meditation. This same study showed a positive relationship between meditative experience and pain relief by focusing on the breath in a non-evaluative manner.

Blood Pressure
  Studies suggest that the long-term practice of meditation improves basic cardio-respiratory functions due to shifting of the autonomic balance in favor of parasympathetic (the body’s relaxation system) instead of sympathetic system (the body’s stress response system). Higher activation of the parasympathetic nervous system results in lower blood pressure.

  explanation: "Grants sharper levels of concentration, memory, and confidence. Awards higher mood stability, reduced stress and anxiety, a healthier cardiovascular system, protection from stomach pains, headaches, and a variety of cancers, and improvement in overall mental and physical functions."
  tips: "-It may be easier to purchase a 1 liter water bottle and sip this throughout the day, partitioning half in the morning and afternoon, and the other remaining half in the evening and night.\n\n-Calculate this transmutation only in water as other forms of beverages may contain added sweeteners, caffeine, or dehydrating components (e.g. soda, coffee, etc.)."
  more: "Overall Benefits
  Water is the most important nutrient we need. It is the cornerstone of physical health as all chemical reactions in the body rely on water to function. Being just 2% dehydrated is associated with increased anxiety, disruptions in mood and lower cognitive functioning.

Proper hydration is essential for maintaining optimal mental and physical health. By maintaining body fluid balance, research suggests that the risks of certain diseases, infections, kidney stones, and possibly even some cancers can be reduced if not entirely prevented.

  Water acts as a transporter of nutrients, regulates body temperature, lubricates joint and internal organs, provides structure to cells and tissues, and can help preserve cardiovascular function. Water consumption may also facilitate weight management.

  It only takes 1-2% of mild dehydration for you to experience reduced endurance, reduced motivation, poor concentration, slower reaction times, moodiness, and anxiety.  Research shows that this 1-2% of mild dehydration negatively affects memory, perceptual discrimination, arithmetic ability, visuomotor tracking, and psychomotor skills. Additionally, headaches, stomach pains, and constipation are strongly linked with not getting enough fluids.

  explanation: "Grants stronger immunity, greater concentration, creativity, problem-solving skills, balance, and coordination, and sharper memory. Protects against weight gain, diabetes, and heart disease. Also grants better regulation of hormones that control digestion and growth."
  tips: "-Avoid greasy and fried foods before bedtime. These kinds of foods may cause indigestion which can disrupt sleep.\n\n-Avoid all caffeine (especially after noon).\n\n-Sleep and wake up at the same time every day (even on weekends!). This practice allows your body to anticipate when it’s time to go to sleep which helps it calibrate melatonin release—which makes you sleepier at bedtime.\n\n-Create a night routine that you can stick with, to train your body to recognize when it’s time for sleep and increase the quality of the sleep you get.\n\n-Expose yourself to early morning sunlight (this will help regulate the body clock to know when to release sleep-inducing chemicals at night).\n\n-Limit screen exposure several hours before bedtime.\n\n-Use Nightshift mode on screens several hours before bedtime. Nightshift mode allows screens to emit less blue light (the color of sunlight) in favor of warmer colors (the color of the sun at dusk)."
  more: "Benefits
  Modern research suggests sleep duration that deviates from 7-8 hours is linked impaired memory, judgement, concentration, creativity and problem solving skills, moodiness, quick-temperedness, increased depression and anxiety, a weakened immune system, high blood pressure, a higher risk of weight gain, diabetes, heart disease, seizures, and migraines, a drop in testosterone, higher levels of inflammation, and poorer balance and coordination.

Weight Management
  The hormone leptin tells our brain that we’ve had enough to eat—without enough sleep our brain reduces leptin and raises ghrelin, which is an appetite stimulant.  Thus a lack of sleep can contribute to weight gain.  Sleep deprivation also prompts your body to release higher levels of insulin after meals.  Higher insulin levels promote fat storage and increase the risk for type II diabetes.

Immunity
When we sleep, our immune system releases compounds called cytokines.  Cytokines have a protective effect on the immune system by helping fight inflammation and infection.  Without enough sleep, there may be insufficient cytokines to keep us from getting ill.
  A 2013 research study found that sleep restrictions increase the amount of inflammatory compounds in a person’s body.  Such compounds are linked to conditions like asthma and allergies.  The researchers also studied people who had long-term sleep deprivation as well as limited sleep deprivation of 4 to 5 hours a night for a week.  In both cases, the researchers found that participants immune systems were negatively affected by lack of sleep.
  Epidemiological studies have shown that short or insufficient sleep is associated with lower brain function increased risk for metabolic diseases and mortality.

Brain Connections
  A healthy amount of sleep is vital for “brain plasticity” or the brain’s ability to adapt to input.  If we sleep too little, we become unable to process what we’ve learned during the day and we have more trouble remembering it in the future.

Life Span
  Researchers in the UK and Italy analyzed data from 16 separate studies conducted over 25 years, covering more than 1.3 million people and more than 100,000 deaths.  Results found that those who generally slept for less than six hour a night were 12% more likely to experience a premature death.  People who slept more than eight to nine hours per night had an even higher risk, at 30%.

  tips: "-Fish oil capsules are a great resource to use to supplement Omega-3s.\n\n-Try to aim for at least 1,000 milligrams of EPA Omega-3 fatty acids per day in your supplementation, and about 500 milligrams of DHA. For purity, look for brands that include on the label “molecularly distilled” to ensure as little pollutants as possible (such as mercury, a common pollutant found in today’s fish).\n\n-Taking your fish oil capsule with a vitamin C supplement (an antioxidant) will help protect the omega-3s from being damaged by free radicals in the bloodstream, ensuring that your brain is able to make full use of the fatty acids."
  more: " Omega-3 fatty acids are critical building blocks for brain structure and function. Found mainly in fish, wild game, nuts, and leafy vegetables, this essential fat is crucial for health on a multitude of levels.

The Perfect Ratio
  Several sources of information suggest that humans evolved on a diet with a ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 essential fatty acids of approximately 1:1 whereas in Western diets the ratio is as high as 20:1. Omega-3s have virtually disappeared from the American diet in the last half century, causing a dramatic imbalance that leads to mental and bodily illnesses. In 2005, up to 96,000 deaths in the U.S. were attributed to a deficiency in omega-3 fatty acids alone.

Relieving Inflammation
  While omega-6 promotes inflammation, omega-3 promotes anti-inflammation. Without Omega-3 to balance its counterpart, studies show we are more susceptible to cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, cancer, eye degeneration and chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation is linked to diabetes, clogged arteries, Alzheimer’s disease, allergies, asthma, stroke, and metabolic syndrome. Inflammation also impairs the function of the brain regions such as the hippocampus, critical for memory function. Lower ratios are also associated with suppressed inflammation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and holds beneficial effects on patients with asthma.

Relieving Depression
  When brain cells don’t have enough omega-3 fats, they have trouble utilizing serotonin, which regulates appetite and mood. This leads to a massive loss of serotonin function throughout the brain, increasing a person’s vulnerability to the sort of out-of-control stress response that triggers onset of depression. There is a similar dysfunction with the neurotransmitter dopamine, which plays a major role in motivation.
  Clinical research has been using omega-3 fatty acids to treat depression. British researchers studied a group of depressed patients who failed to recover after taking anti-depressant medication for 8 weeks. All studied patients stayed on their meds as prescribed, but 70% were also given omega 3 Fatty Acid supplements.  All 70% of patients who took the supplement went on to recover compared to the 30% that continued to take only the anti-depressants.  Thus, there is contention that omega-3 fatty acids are one of the most effective anti-depressant substances ever discovered.

Immunity
  There is evidence that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids could improve the function of the lymphatic system, which facilitates the clearance of waste from the brain and promotes the clearance of metabolites, helping prevent Alzheimer’s disease.

Overall Health
  Omega-3s play important roles in the body as components of the phospholipids that form the the structures of cell membranes.  It also provides energy for the body and are used to form eicosanoids.  Eicosanoids are signaling molecules that have similar chemical structures to the fatty acids from which they are derived; they have wide-ranging functions in the body’s cardiovascular, pulmonary (lung function), immune, and endocrine systems (hormonal regulation).  Thus omega-3’s are vital for these processes to work properly.
  Omega-3 fatty acids are conditionally essential nutrients that enhance the quality of life and lower the risk of premature death.  Shown to aid in postnatal brain development, and influential over behavior and mood. It is also shown to help with AD/HD, autism, dyspraxia, dyslexia, and aggression.  Other major benefits have been recorded in bipolar disorder, with promising results in schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder. Additionally, cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment correlates with lower tissue levels of DHA/EPA which are types of omega-3 fatty acids in the body.
  Omega-3s are found to offer protection from cardiovascular disease by reducing the heart’s susceptibility to arrhythmias, lowering triglyceride levels, lowering blood pressure, and decreasing blood clots. In one study, omega-3s from fish and fish oil supplements were found to reduce the rates of all-cause mortality (all causes of death), and stroke. Research also shows, lower ratios of omega-6/omega-3s in women with breast cancer is associated with decreased risk.

  more: "Overview
  The beneficial effects of regular physical activity on health are indisputable in the field of modern medicine. Numerous studies have shown that exercise improve one’s self esteem and a sense of wellbeing.  Individuals who exercise regularly exhibit slower rates of age-related memory and cognitive decline in comparison to those who are more sedentary.  Adults who engage in regular physical activity experience fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms, thus supporting the notion that exercise offers a protective effect agains the development of mental disorders.  Exercise reduces percent body fat and promotes higher muscle strength and efficiency while helping maintain bone strength and structure, leading to preventions of bone frailty later in life. There is evidence to suggest the endurance exercise attenuates age-associated changes to skin in humans and mice by stimulating interleukin-15, which is a novel regulator of mitochondrial function in aging skin.  Thus exercise confers health benefits to the skin and may prove a beneficial strategy to delay skin aging.

Relieving Depression
  Exercise of any intensity significantly improves feelings of depression with whether it is light, moderate, or hard exercise. It should be noted that antidepressant usage does not limit the mood-enhancing effect of acute exercise. A study of 156 depressed patients were randomly assigned to treatment of either Zoloft (a commonly prescribed antidepressant medicine) or exercise. The exercise consisted of a brisk half-hour walk 3x a week and proved to be more effective than Zoloft, especially in the longterm. Exercise increases the activity of important brain chemicals like serotonin and dopamine (which regulate mood and motivation respectively) and stimulates the release of a key growth hormone, BDNF, (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor) which helps reverse the toxic, brain-damaging effects of depression.

Relieving Stress
  Stress-induced depressive and anxious behaviors are correlated with decreased BDNF levels especially in the hippocampus. BDNF levels, however, Increases following physical activity. These changes in BDNF increases functioning of the system related to serotonin and may promote neuronal growth. Exercise is also believed to positively influence the growth and development of nervous tissue in the hippocampus such as endorphins, vascular endothelial growth factor, and serotonin, all of which relate to stress levels. A number of research studies have pointed to the effectiveness of short-term aerobic exercise to reduce anxiety sensitivity. Exposing someone with high anxiety sensitivity to the physiological symptoms they fear, such as a rapid heartbeat, in the context of physical exercise increases their tolerance for such symptoms.

Energy Levels
  Twelve population-based studies conducted between January 1945 and February 2005 that concurrently measured physical activity and feelings of energy and fatigue were located. All studies showed evidence between physical activity and a reduced risk of experiencing feelings of low energy and fatigue when active adults were compared with their sedentary peers. Studies show a positive association between weekly physical activity and the frequency with which people reported feeling energetic.

Sleep
  Studies reveal that acute exercise has small beneficial effects on total sleep time, sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency, stage 1 sleep, slow wave sleep, time after sleep onset, and a small effect on rapid eye movement sleep (REM). Regular exercise has small beneficial effects on total sleep time and sleep efficiency. One study found that 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity per week can provide up to a 65% improvement in sleep quality.

Muscle Growth
  Exercise has a profound effect on muscle growth. Resistance exercise improves muscle protein balance, but, in the absence of food intake, the balance remains negative (catabolic). The response of muscle protein metabolism to a resistance exercise bout lasts 1-2 days; thus food consumed in this amount of time will determine the balance between creation and breakdown of muscle.

Overall Health
  The regular practice of physical exercise has been shown to have beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of high blood pressure, insulin resistance, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, and mental disorders. Physical inactivity and low physical conditioning level have been considered as risk factors for early mortality so important as smoking, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure.  Studies clearly demonstrate that the regular practice of physical exercise is effective for the prevention and control of diabetes type 2, regardless of family history, weight, and other cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking and high blood pressure.  Research shows that physical activity (which may be considered to have antioxidant effects) may modulate skin diseases through effects on oxidative stress, by protecting against ROS/RNS damage. (Reactive oxygen species/reactive oxygen species)

Recommendations
  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends 30 minutes of moderate to high-intensity exercise for at least 5 days a week for all healthy individuals. Evidence suggests this will prevent a large variety of chronic diseases. The 2008 federal physical activity guidelines seconds this recommendation in addition to 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week. Performance of at least four weekly hours of physical activity from moderate to intense decreased 70% of incidence of diabetes type 2 on average, in relation to the inactive lifestyle after four years of follow-up.

  instructions: "Spend 15 minutes in nature. (This includes parks and greenspaces)"
  explanation: "Reduces anxiety and depression. Grants stronger immunity, healthier blood pressure levels, improved mood, and calmness."
  tips: "-Finding nature doesn’t have to equate to a large forest or the beach. An open park is perfectly fine, even in the winter.\n\n-Don’t worry if you can’t find the time to go out into nature every day. Studies show that even once or twice a week is enough to reap benefits days or even weeks down the line."
  more: " It is empirically known that exposure to stimuli from natural sources induces a state of hyperawareness and activation of the parasympathetic nervous system that renders a person in the state of relaxation, as well as a host of other benefits.

Relieving Stress
  From 2005 to 2015, a physiological experiment was conducted over a one-week period on 744 participants in 62 forests located all of Japan. There are many reports related to this experiment describing indicators such as salivary cortisol levels (stress hormones), heart rate, variability-related sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous activity, blood pressure, and pulse—all of which measure the state of relaxation.
  In one study, results indicated that cortisol levels (stress hormones) of participants was 13.4% lower after viewing the forest area compared to after viewing the urban area. The pulse rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were lower by 6%, 1.7%, and 1.6% respectively. High-frequency component (HF) which is known to reflect parasympathetic nervous activity (the relaxation system) increased by 56.1% during forest therapy, and the LF/HF ratio, which reflects the sympathetic nervous activity (the stress system) decreased by 18%. In a walking experiment, cortisol levels were 15.8% lower after walking in the forest area compared to walking in the urban area. HF increased by 102% and LF/HF ratio decreased by 19.4%. Based on these results, it can be concluded that forest therapy had the following effects: (1) it decreased the levels of salivary cortisol, a typical stress hormone; (2) it decreased the pulse rate; (3) it decreased the systolic and diastolic blood pressures; (4) it increased HF; and (5) it decreased the LF/HF ratio. These findings show that viewing or walking around a forest environment for a 15 minute session of forest therapy induces a state of physiological relaxation. The results were almost identical to those of an experiment conducted on 420 participants in 35 locations.

Immune System
  Studies also demonstrate a boosting effect of forest therapy on weakened immune functions. Twelve males between the ages 37 and 55 with weakened immune functions were studied to observe the effects on natural killer (NK) cell activity. The forest therapy lasted two nights and three days. Participants walked through the forest for approximately 2 hours on two consecutive days. NK-cell activity had increased by 1.25 times on Day 1 and 1.5 times on Day 2. Thus, this finding confirmed the immunity-boosting effects of forest therapy on NK cell activity. High NK cell activity levels were maintained at one week, and they were found to be maintained at one month.

Urban Green Spaces
  Research shows that living in areas with accessible green spaces for walking also increases longevity of senior citizens. There is evidence for physiological and psychological benefits of urban green spaces. A brief, 15 minute walk, in any season, in an urban park shifted the body to a more relaxed state with slower heart rates, and improved mood. These results were also observed simply observing a kiwifruit garden for 10 minutes.
Ion Balance
Negative ions are produced in nature, especially in abundance of moving water and after thunderstorms. Negative ion exposure is associated with reducing depression. Thirty-three studies from 1957-2012 evaluate the effects of air ionization and mental states. Meta-analysis results showed that negative ionization, overall, was significantly associated with lower depression ratings, with a stronger association observed at high levels of negative ion exposure.

  instructions: "Spend 20 minutes outside, preferably in direct sunlight. Or take one dose of at least 2,000 IU Vitamin D3."
  explanation: "Grants focus, improved mood and sleep quality. Protects against cancer, autoimmune disease, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and infections. Reduces depression, anxiety, and inflammation. Also grants stronger bones, teeth, immunity, leanness of muscle tissue, and higher physical strength."
  tips: "-In the continental United States, your body should make enough Vitamin D from May through August if you average 10-15 minutes of sun exposure between 11AM to 3PM.\n\n-In March, April, September, and October, it will probably take at least 30 minutes per day.\n\n-For dark complexions, double all recommended times.\n\n-It is a good idea to supplement from November through February.\n\n-If there is very little sunlight in your geographic area, (especially during winter months) you can use a light box; as over seventy research studies show, bright light therapy yields better results for SAD (seasonal affective disorder) patients than medication. Specifically, any light box with fluorescent bulbs with 10,000 lux is more than sufficient."
  more: " Insufficient sun exposure has become a major public health problem, demanding an immediate change in the current sun avoidance public health advice. At least 1,000 different genes governing virtually every tissue in the body are now thought to be regulated by Vitamin D3, including several involved in calcium metabolism and neuromuscular and immune system functioning.

Bones and Teeth
  Vitamin D3 helps enhance phosphorus absorption (phosphorus aids in the formation of bones and teeth, and plays an important role in how the body uses carbohydrates and fats. It is also needed for the body to make protein for growth, maintenance, and repair of cells and tissues). Vitamin D helps control the flow of calcium into and out of bones to regulate bone-calcium and metabolism.
  The primary physiologic function of Vitamin D is to maintain serum calcium and phosphorous levels within the normal physiologic range to support most metabolic functions, neuromuscular transmission (helps muscles function), and bone mineralization.  Without sufficient vitamin D, bones will not form properly. Low levels of Vitamin D causes osteoporosis.

Overall Health
   High vitamin D levels reduces the risk of all cancers. Evidence suggests that high levels of Vitamin D may decrease the risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS). Children who received 2,000 IU D per day from 1 year of age had a 80% decreased risk of developing type 1 diabetes later in life.
  Evidence suggests higher levels of Vitamin D helps prevent cardiovascular diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune diseases, collagen-induced arthritis, lyme arthritis, autoimmune encephalomyelitis, thyroiditis, inflammatory bowel disease, high blood pressure, prostate and colon cancer, bacterial and viral infections such as influenza, bronchitis, gastroenteritis, tuberculosis, and septicemia.

Relieving Depression
  When deprived of needed light exposure, our body clock is thrown out of sync. The stability of our hormone levels, quality of sleep, and energy levels are threatened.  For some individuals, this can lead to depression
  On average, depressed patients have very low levels of vitamin D; supplementing vitamin D is linked to a large antidepressant effect due to its powerful anti-inflammatory properties (depression is an inflammatory disease). Higher levels of sunlight exposure is linked to increased serotonin production. Serotonin helps us feel calm and happy, hence its antidepressant effect.

Seasonal Considerations
  Over half of the U.S. population is now deficient of Vitamin D at the end of each winter, with many at low levels all year long. This low level of Vitamin D is linked to seasonal affective disorder (SAD) which is a common type of depression. Studies estimate 20% of the population endure the “winter blues” caused by a lack of light exposure, disrupting the body clock and depleting serotonin circuits, leading to depression and anxiety. Thus it may be important to supplement with vitamin D in the winter times, depending on geographic area.

Prosocial Behavior
Research shows that bright light exposure also boosts our sociability.  A study found that people under the influence of bright light tend to be more cooperative and friendly with others.
Geographic considerations
  Americans living at a latitude above 37 degrees increase the risk of developing MS throughout life by greater than 100%—the skin makes little vitamin D from the sun at this latitude and above with the exception of the summer months. Many studies show that cancer-related death rates decline as one moves toward the lower latitudes below 37 degrees. Thus is may be important to supplement if you live above the 37 degree line.

Too much sun?
  UVA radiation can contribute to skin cancer via generation of DNA-damaging molecules such as hydroxyl and oxygen radicals. Sunburn is caused by too much UVB radiation; this form also leads to direct DNA damage and promotes various skin cancers. Both forms can damage collagen fibers, destroy vitamin A in skin, accelerate aging of the skin, and increase the risk of skin cancers. Excessive sun exposure can cause cataracts and diseases aggravated by UVR-induced immunosuppression such as reactivation of some latent viruses.
  However, this excessive UVR exposure accounts for only 0.1% of the total global burden of disease in disability-adjusted life years, according to the 2006 World Health Organization (WHO). In contrast, the same WHO report noted that a markedly larger annual disease burden of 3.3 billion Disability-Adjusted Life Years worldwide might result from very low levels of UVR exposure. There are around 30-40 times more deaths from cancers related to a lack of vitamin D than there are from too much sun exposure (skin cancer).

Recommendations
  The National Institute of Health recommends 10-15 minutes of sun exposure as a way most people can avoid vitamin D deficiency. Research shows people feel some elevation of mood in less than two hours of being exposed to bright light.
  Adequate vitamin D synthesis takes about the same amount of sun exposure that’s required to develop the faintest hint of a tan (or to turn your skin ever so slightly darker)
  In order to keep our body clock on track, we should spend at least 20 to 30 minutes under bright light exposure each morning.

Number 1 on their list of the most important dietary risks was not eating enough fruit, responsible for an estimated 4.9 million deaths a year around the world.
  According to the Union of Concerned Scientists: “If Americans ate just one more serving of fruits or vegetables per day, this would save more than 30,000 lives and $5 billion in medical costs each year.

Overall Health
  Studies show that plants protect us via their antiplatelet effects.  Platelets are what trigger blood clots that cause heart attacks and most strokes. Platelets are also considered to play a pivotal inflammatory role in hardening of the arteries in the first place, and in allergies, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer.
  Numerous studies suggest that polyphenols and other plant-derived bioactivities affect animal and human brain function by lowering oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is commonly associated with diabetes, atherosclerosis, inflammatory conditions, high blood pressure, heart disease, cancer, and neurodegenetive diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s.

Age Slower
  In a 1999 study, foods such as strawberries, spinach and blueberries were shown to reverse age-related deficits in several neuronal and behavioral parameters in rats. These findings suggest that in addition to their known beneficial effects on cancer and heart disease, phytochemicals present in antioxidant-rich foods may be beneficial in reversing the course of neuronal and behavioral aging .

Cognitive Function and Memory
  A study on Concord’s 100% grape juice found evidence to suggest that it may enhance cognitive function for older adults with early memory decline. The study found significant improvements in a measure of verbal learning and non-significant enhancement of verbal and spatial recall. Another 2012 study mirrored these effects, with blueberry, strawberry, blackberry, and plum juice extracts. A 2010 study found that daily consumption of wild blueberry juice in a sample of 9 older adults improved paired associate learning and word list recall after 12 weeks.

 Lower Inflammation
  A 2012 study found evidence that consumption of blueberries may be a strategy to forestall or even reverse age-related neuronal deficits, as well as their subsequent behavioral manifestations, in order to increase healthy aging.  Research suggests that the polyphonic compounds found in blueberries exert their beneficial effects either through their ability to lower oxidative stress and inflammation or directly by altering the signaling involved in neuronal communication. These interventions, in turn, may protect against age-related deficits in cognitive and motor function.

Reduced Depression
  One study found that patients who consumed wild blueberry juice over 12 weeks experienced reduced depressive symptoms and lower glucose levels.

  explanation: "Protects against heart disease, weight gain, acne, diabetes, cancer, depression, anxiety, premature aging, fatigue, kidney disease, and fatty liver disease. Grants a longer life span."
  tips: "-Research shows that the addiction to sugar is virtually identical with addictions caused by hard drugs such as cocaine. If it seems difficult to break from sugary foods, realize that this is exactly how hard drug addicts feel at the thought of breaking away from their substance of abuse\n\n-To break the sugar habit, we suggest you spend time to detox from all sugar products and allow yourself to go through the physical withdrawals (yes these are real) from sugar. Symptoms of withdrawal to anticipate are: headaches, hormonal fluctuations, and low mood. This detox period can last anywhere from 3-21 days.\n\n-Actively read nutrition labels of foods before you purchase them. Enormous amounts of sugar are hidden in foods like yogurt, canned pasta sauce, and protein bars.\n\n-To keep blood sugar levels stable throughout the detox period, aim for balanced meals that contain protein, fiber, and healthy fats—these meals can look like white egg omelettes with veggies, chicken salads with olive oil, and meat and veggie stews."
  more: "Added sugar is the single worst ingredient in the modern diet.  Limiting sugar intake as much as possible will help ensure a healthy, happy, long lasting life.

Weight Gain
  Rates of obesity are rising worldwide and sugar, especially from sugar-sweetened beverages, is thought to be one of the main culprits. Research shows that specific types of dietary sugars may be capable of inducing leptin resistance. There is evidence that diet-induced leptin resistance is capable of increasing energy intake and increasing body weight gain—thus rendering it a potential cause for excess body weight gain and obesity. A system review of meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies provide ample evidence that sugar-sweetened beverages, including sugary teas, fruit juices, and sodas, promotes weight gain in children and adults.

Overeating
  Research has found that parallel to neuroimaging findings, fructose versus glucose leads to greater hunger and desire for food and a greater willingness to give up long-term monetary rewards to obtain immediate high-calorie foods. Findings suggest that ingestion of fructose relative to glucose results in greater activation of brain regions involved in attention and reward processing and may promote feeding behavior.

Heart Disease
  High-sugar diets, more than high saturated fat diets, have been associated with an increase in the risk of many diseases, including heart disease—the number one cause of death worldwide. Evidence suggests that high-sugar diets can lead to obesity, inflammation, and high triglyceride, blood sugar, and blood pressure levels—all risk factors for heart disease. Additionally, consuming too much sugar, especially from sugar-sweetened drinks, have been linked to atherosclerosis, a disease characterized by fatty, artery-clogging deposits. A study in over 30,000 people found that those who consumed 17-21% of calories from added sugar had a 38% greater risk of dying from heart disease, compared to those consuming only 8% of calories for added sugar.

Acne
  A diet high in refined carbs, including sugary foods and drinks, has been associated with a higher risk of developing acne. One study found that frequently consuming added sugars had a 30% greater risk of developing acne, while those who regularly ate pastries and cakes had a 20% greater risk. Many populations studies have shown that rural communities that consume traditional, non-processed foods have almost non-existent rates of acne, compared to more urban, high-income areas.

Diabetes
  There is a clear link between excessive sugar consumption and diabetes risk. Obesity, which is caused by consuming too much sugar, is considered the strongest risk factor for diabetes. Prolonged high-sugar consumption also drives resistance to insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates blood sugar levels. Studies show insulin resistance causes blood sugar levels to rise and strongly increase the risk of diabetes  A population study of over 175 countries found that the risk of developing diabetes grew by 1.1% for every 150 calories of sugar, or about one can of soda, consumed per day.
Other studies have shown that people who drink sugar-sweetened beverages, including fruit juice, are more likely to develop diabetes.

Cancer
  Excessive amounts of sugar will increase the risk of developing certain cancers. Since a diet rich in sugar foods and beverages can lead to obesity, this significantly raises the risk of cancer according to research. Furthermore, evidence shows that diets high in sugar increase inflammation in the body and may cause insulin resistance—both of which increases cancer risk. A study in over 430,000 found that added sugar consumption was positively associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer, pleural cancer, and cancer of the small intestine. Another study showed that women who consumed sweet buns and cookies more than three timer per week were 1.42 times more likely to develop endometrial cancer than women who consumed these foods less than 2 times a month.

Depression
  A diet high in added sugar and processed foods may increase chances of developing depression. Consuming an excess of processed foods, including high-sugar product such as cakes and sugary drinks, have been associated with a higher risk of depression, according to several studies. A study following 8,000 people for 22 years showed that men who consumed 67 grams of more of sugar per day were 23% more likely to develop depression than men who ate less than 40 grams per day. Overall, sugar intake from sweet food/beverage resulted in adverse long-term psychological health.  Another study in over 69,000 women demonstrated that those with the highest intakes of added sugars had a significantly greater risk of depression, compared to those with the lowest intakes.

Skin Aging
  Advanced glycation end products are compounds formed by reactions between sugar and protein in the body. These are suspected to play a key role in skin aging. Consuming a diet high in refined carbs and sugar leads to the production of AGEs (Advanced Glycation End Products), which may cause the skin to age prematurely. The production of AGEs can also contribute to organ damage in liver, skeletal and cardiac muscle, and the brain.

Cellular Aging
  Telomeres are structures found at the end of chromosomes, which are molecules that hold part or all of genetic information. They act as protective caps, preventing chromosomes from deteriorating or fusing together. As we age, telomeres naturally shorten which causes cells to age and malfunction. Consuming high amounts of sugar has been shown to accelerate telomere shortening, which increases cellular aging. A study in 5,309 adults showed that regularly drinking sugar-sweetened beverages was associated with shorter telomere length and premature cellular aging. Daily 20-ounce servings of sugar-sweetened soda equated to 4.6 additional years of aging, independent of other variables.

Lower Energy
  Evidence suggests products that are loaded with sugar but lacking in protein, fiber, or fat lead to a brief energy boost that’s quickly followed by a sharp drop in blood sugar, often referred to as a crash. Research shows having constant blood sugar swings can lead to unstable energy levels.

Fatty Liver
  A high intake of refined fructose has been consistently linked with an increased risk of fatty liver. Unlike glucose and other types of sugar, which are taken up by many cells throughout the body, fructose is almost exclusively broken down by the liver. The liver can only store so much glycogen before excess amounts are turned into fat. Large amounts of added sugar in the form of fructose overload the liver, leading to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) a condition that is characterized by excessive buildup in the liver.

Other Health Risks
  Research shows that too much added sugar can increase kidney disease risk, negatively impact dental health, increase the risk of developing gout, and accelerate cognitive decline.

Doing it at night can help you unwind before bed.\n\n-Consider putting on relaxing music while you perform your pose(s) if you find it helps your state."
  more: "Derived from the Sanskrit word “yuji,” meaning union, yoga is an ancient practice that brings together mind and body.

Relieving Stress
  Multiple studies show yoga can decrease the secretion of cortisol, the primary stress hormone. After a three-month yoga program, one study found that participants had significantly less levels of cortisol. They also had lower levels of stress, anxiety, fatigue, and depression. Another study of 131 people had similar results, showing that 10 weeks of yoga also improved quality of life and mental health.
  In one study, 34 women diagnosed with an anxiety disorder participated in yoga classes twice weekly for two months. By the end of the study, those who practiced yoga had significantly lower levels of anxiety than the control group. Another study followed 64 women with PTSD, which is characterized by severe anxiety. After 10 weeks, the women who practiced yoga once weekly had fewer symptoms of PTSD—of which 52% were cured entirely. Yoga has also been found to decrease anxiety and facilitate post-traumatic growth in breast cancer survivors, in addition to increasing vigor and spirituality

Relieving Inflammation
  Chronic inflammation can contribute to the development of pro-inflammatory diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.  At the end of one study, individuals who practiced yoga had lower levels of inflammatory markers than those who didn’t. It also decreased levels of cholesterol, and triglycerides, which reduced the risk of heart attack and stroke. Similarly, a 2014 study showed that 12 weeks of yoga reduced inflammatory markers in breast cancer survivors with persistent fatigue.

Heart Health
  Studies show that yoga may help improve heart health and reduce several factors for heart disease. A study found that participants over 40 years of age who practiced yoga for five years had a lower blood pressure and pulse rate than those who didn’t. Lower blood pressure helps reduce the risks of heart attacks and stroke. Overall, the results indicated that yoga reduces age related deterioration in cardiovascular functions. A study of 113 patients with heart disease found that one year of yoga training, in addition to a healthier diet and stress management resulted in a 26% reduction in “bad” LDL cholesterol.  The progression of heart disease stopped in 47% of patients.

Quality of Life
  In one study, 135 seniors were assigned to either six months of yoga, walking, or a control group. Practicing yoga significantly improved quality of life, as well as mood and energy, compared to the other groups. In a study following women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy, yoga decreased symptoms of chemotherapy such as nausea and vomiting, while also improving overall quality of life. A similar study looked at how eight weeks of yoga affected women with breast cancer. By the end of the study, the women has less pain and fatigue with improvements in levels of invigoration, acceptance, and relaxation.

Relieving Depression
  Studies show that yoga is able to decrease levels of cortisol, that influences levels of serotonin, the neurotransmitter linked with depression. In a study on Sudarshan Kriya, a type of yoga that focuses on rhythmic breathing, participants had fewer symptoms of depression and lower levels of cortisol after 2 weeks. Other studies mirrored these results, showing a link between practicing yoga and decreasing symptoms of depression. This included reports of decreased levels of negative mood and fatigue following yoga classes.

Relieving Pain
  A growing body of research denotes that practicing yoga can help reduce types of chronic pain. A study of 42 individuals with carpal tunnel syndrome either received a wrist splint or yoga for 8 weeks. At the end of the study, yoga was found to be more effective in reducing pain and improving grip strength than wrist splinting.  A 2005 study showed that you can help decrease pain and improve physical function in participants with osteoarthritis of the knees.

Sleep Quality
  A 2005 study with 69 elderly patients were assigned to either practice yoga, take a herbal preparation or be part of the control group. The yoga group fell asleep faster, slept longer (on average an increase of 60 minutes), and felt more well-rested in the morning. A study with cancer patients mirrored these outcomes. Another study had participants undergo yogic practices for 3 months; the results found a great improvement in cardiorespiratory performance and psychological profile. Maximum night time melatonin (the hormone that signals sleep) in the yoga group showed a significant correlation with well-being score.

Flexibility and Balance
  A study that looked at the impact of 10 weeks of yoga on 26 college male athletes found significant increases in measures of flexibility and balance, compared to the control group—thus enhancing athletic performances. In the span of a year, another study showed that total flexibility of a yoga group consisting of 66 elderly participants increased their flexibility by nearly 4x that of the calisthenics group. A 2013 study found that practicing yoga helped improve balance and mobility in older adults.

Breathing
  Pranayama, or yogic breathing, is a practice in yoga that focuses on controlling the breath through breathing exercises and techniques.  In one study, 287 college students took a 15-week class where they were taught various yoga poses and breathing exercises.  At the end of the study they had a significant increase in vital capacity. Vital capacity is a measure of the maximum amount of air that can be expelled from the lung. It is important for those with lung disease, hearth problems, and asthma. A 2009 study found that practicing yogic breathing improved symptoms and lung function in patients with mild-to-moderate asthma. Various studies show the effectiveness of these breathing exercises in high blood pressure, diabetes, and coronary artery disease as well.

Relieving Headaches
  Increasing evidence shows that yoga could be a useful adjunct therapy to help reduce migraine frequency. A 2007 study divided 72 patients with migraines into either yoga therapy or a self-care group for three months. Practicing yoga led to reductions in headache intensity, frequency, and pain compared to the self-care group.  Another study treated 60 patients with migraines using conventional care with or without yoga. Doing yoga resulted in a greater decrease in headache frequency and intensity than conventional care alone.  Yoga therapy enhanced vagal tone and thus parasympathetic activity, improving cardiac autonomic balance.

Healthy Eating
  Yoga’s similarity on the emphasis of mindfulness is linked to encourage healthy eating behaviors. One study incorporate yoga into an outpatient eating disorder treatment program with 54 patients, finding that yoga helped reduce both eating disorder symptoms and preoccupation with food. Yoga was also found to cause a decrease in episodes of binge eating, an increase in physical activity and a small decrease in weight.

Strength
  In one study, 79 adults performed 24 cycles of sun salutations—a series of foundational poses often used as a warm-up—six days a week for 24 weeks. They experienced a significant increase in upper body strength, endurance, and weight loss.  Such strength gains included increases in bench press, shoulder press, and longer endurance doing push ups and sit ups. Women had a decrease in body fat percentage as well. A 2015 study had similar findings, showing that 12 weeks of practice led to improvements in endurance, strength, and flexibility.
