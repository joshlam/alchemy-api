  instructions: "Write down 3 things you are grateful for."
  explanation: "Writing in a gratitude log leads to an increase in emotional stability, prosocial
behavior, inner peace, and optimism for the future. It is linked with reduced
anxiety and depression, and improved sleep quality."
  tips: "Try to write in your gratitude journal at the same time every day. Writing at the
end of the day may be easier because you can reflect on the dayʼs events for
gratitude."
  more: "Gratitude has been viewed as a crucial determinant of well-being according to
several studies. Research shows that gratitude helps create emotional
foundations of peace and happiness, as well as greater optimism about the future.
Research in the social effects of gratitude include grateful people tending to
interpret help as being more valuable, by interpreting deeper expressions of
kindness and caring, allowing for stronger social bonds. This prosocial behavior
also translated to thicker emotional skin, as demonstrated by gratitude practicers
keeping their bearing in the face of rude or negative interactions.
Gratitude brings balance to the body. Grateful people are projected to have
greater optimism across adult years—this optimism is strongly linked with positive
health outcomes across time, research suggests. Gratitude is also shown to be a
strong cultivator of conscientiousness, a trait that encourages proactivity, getting

good nutrition, maintaining a social support base, and responsibly seeking medical
care when needed. There is evidence that gratitude journaling also increases the
likelihood of exercising—as one study found gratitude practicing groups exercised
for 1.5 more hours on average per week than their non-practicing counterparts.
Stress reactivity is measured through psychological health. Because gratitude
eases stress reactivity by itʼs impact on our psychological health, we put our
bodies through less stress and conserve energy. We become more peaceful.
It is conceivable that individuals with excellent mental health to begin with are
those more likely to practice gratitude in the first place. Although true, it does not
explain the success of gratitude interventions, whereby individuals from a wide
range of age groups and occupations saw significant psychological and
physiological improvements by the sole act of recording grateful thoughts. To be
sure, studies have also controlled for the Big Five Personality Types to confirm
that personality did not play a role in receiving benefits with gratitude journaling.
In matters of sleep, gratitude practice predicts greater subjective sleep quality and
sleep duration, and less sleep latency and daytime dysfunction. This relationship
has been established through pre-sleep thoughts that affect sleep quality,
indicating that gratitude listing before bed is helpful for better sleep. A 2009
study of 401 people—40% of whom had clinical sleep disorders, found that the
most grateful people had better sleep quality, normalized sleep duration, were
able to fall asleep faster, and had less daytime tiredness compared to those who
werenʼt as thankful."
